# - Main CMake buildscript for mpags-cipher
# Comments in a CMake Script are lines begining with a '#'

# - Set CMake requirements then declare project
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)
project(MPAGSCipher VERSION 0.2.0)

# - When Makefiles are generated, output all command lines by default
#   Do this to begin with so it's easy to see what compiler command/flags
#   are used. This can also be done by removing the 'set' command and
#   running make as 'make VERBOSE=1'.
set(CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON)

# - Don't allow C++ Compiler Vendor Extensions
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

# - Use our standard set of flags
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -Wshadow -pedantic")

# - Add the MPAGSCipher subdirectory to the build
add_subdirectory(MPAGSCipher)

# - Want to enable testing and add the testing subdirectory to the build
enable_testing()
add_subdirectory(Testing)

# - Declare the build of mpags-cipher main program and link it to
# - the MPAGSCipher library
add_executable(mpags-cipher mpags-cipher.cpp)
target_link_libraries(mpags-cipher PRIVATE MPAGSCipher)

# - We've used the PRIVATE scope specifier here a mpags-cipher is the 
# - end point of the build process. We don't need to link anything to it,
# - so nothing needs to know that it uses MPAGSCipher
